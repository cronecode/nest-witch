NEST WITCH was created during the 2016 Game Curious, an initiative from Toronto's
amazing Hand Eye Society. You can read more about it [here](http://handeyesociety.com/game-curious/).

This game owes much to all the program's astoundingly generous volunteers,
but especially to [Liam Clarke](https://github.com/LiamAttClarke), who went
far beyond the call of duty and became my collaborator.

The version of NEST WITCH preserved here was designed with live presentation in mind,
and will not appear again in this form. As such, I'm inclined to let it stand
as an artifact rather than attempting modifications; also, it would be hard, and I'm lazy.

There are plenty of ugly hacks here, but on the day in question, it was fucking magnificent.
