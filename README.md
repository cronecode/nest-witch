NEST WITCH was created during the 2016 [Game Curious] (http://handeyesociety.com/game-curious/), an initiative from Toronto's
amazing Hand Eye Society. It was exhibited in July 2016 at the Ryerson Image Centre.

This game owes much to all the Game Curious volunteers, but especially to my collaborator [Liam Clarke](https://github.com/LiamAttClarke). He is solely to blame for "Sandstorm."
